# Timeline Notes

A chronological log of creative evolution, project origins, phrase development, sketches, prototypes, and domain concept emergence.

Use this file to record:
- approximate dates,
- moments of inspiration,
- transitions between ideas,
- influences,
- and developmental milestones.

Entries here do not need polish.  
They simply capture the movement of your ideas over time.
