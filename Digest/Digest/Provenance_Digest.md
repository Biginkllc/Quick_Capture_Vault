# Provenance Digest

This file logs meaningful uploads, early proofs, idea seeds, recovered notes, sketches, screenshots, and historical artifacts added to the Quick Capture Vault.

Each entry should briefly document:
- **what** was added,
- **when** it originated (approximate is fine),
- **why** it matters,
- **what project(s)** it connects to,
- and **any evolution or insight** it supports.

This digest establishes a clear timeline of your creative development, strengthening provenance and long-term IP protection across the IFAM ecosystem.
