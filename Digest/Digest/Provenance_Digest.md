# Provenance Digest

This file logs meaningful uploads, early proofs, idea seeds, recovered notes, sketches, screenshots, and historical artifacts added to the Quick Capture Vault.

Each entry should briefly document:
- **what** was added,
- **when** it originated (approximate is fine),
- **why** it matters,
- **what project(s)** it connects to,
- and **any evolution or insight** it supports.

This digest establishes a clear timeline of your creative development, strengthening provenance and long-term IP protection across the IFAM ecosystem.

2025-02-xx — Referenced and processed Medium article “How IPFS is Challenging the Web as We Know It” (dated 7/17/2022) as a contextual artifact. The article reflects early Web3 infrastructure thinking around IPFS, blockchain anchoring, censorship resistance, decentralized social networks, and peer-to-peer marketplaces. While several examples cited (e.g., OpenBazaar, early coin assumptions) are now obsolete, the core principles align with and validate later IFAM architectures including Web3tionary, Quick Capture Vault, Blockyright, Peoples3Bay, and MicroscopicGold. Logged for contextual grounding and signal extraction, not authorship.
